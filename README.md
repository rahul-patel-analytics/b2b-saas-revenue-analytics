#  B2B SaaS Revenue & Funnel Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project simulates a B2B SaaS revenue environment to analyze sales funnel efficiency, conversion performance, and revenue contribution across sales reps and acquisition channels.

The objective is to evaluate how leads move through the funnel and identify key revenue drivers using SQL-based analysis.



##  Tools & Technologies

- PostgreSQL
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, NULL Handling)
- GitHub



##  Key Metrics Analyzed

- Lead → Deal Conversion Rate
- Deal → Win Rate
- Lead → Win Rate
- Revenue by Sales Representative
- Revenue Ranking using DENSE_RANK()
- Funnel Performance by Lead Source
- Average Sales Cycle Length



##  Key Insights

- Overall Lead-to-Deal conversion: ~48%
- Deal-to-Win rate: ~32.75%
- Lead-to-Win efficiency: ~15.83%
- LinkedIn is the highest-performing acquisition channel in both conversion and revenue impact.
- While Amit demonstrates the highest win efficiency, Rahul contributes the highest total revenue.
- Average sales cycle is ~18 days, indicating a fast-moving SMB SaaS model.



##  Strategic Observations

- The largest funnel drop occurs at the closing stage, suggesting opportunity for improvement in deal negotiation or pricing strategy.
- LinkedIn should receive increased acquisition focus due to strong ROI.
- Rep performance varies between efficiency-driven and value-driven selling models.
